            <p>
                Less than one year ago, Thierno came to the United States, following other members of his family in
                search of a new home and prosperity. He speaks French Fluently and is quickly learning more and more
                advanced English. Thierno’s family emigrated from Guinea and he is the last child to move to the states
                after his four siblings.
                <br><br>
                After only one month in New York, he joined the Amish team. He’s an incredibly hard worker, balancing
                his shifts with Amish with the intensive English classes he’s taking. Thiernon plans to study computer
                science at school, and enjoys spending his free time playing soccer.

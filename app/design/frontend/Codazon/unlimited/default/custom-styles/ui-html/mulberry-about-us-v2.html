                <div class="_description">We believe in the importance of family and community. Mulberry Market is
                    managed by the seven Hamdan brothers and their father who’s spent nearly 50 years in the grocery
                    business.
                    <br><br>
                    The Hamdans opened Mulberry Market in February 2020 after three years of renovations and upgrades
                    that brought new life to NOLITA’s most convenient supermarket. With self-checkout, online ordering,
                    and an attentive staff, the Hamdan brothers are committed to a blend of technology and personal
                    service. Mulberry Market is ready for the modern age and the safety concerns brought about by the
                    coronavirus pandemic.

                    <br><br>
                    Arriving in New York City in the summer of 1962 at the age of 18, Nayef Hamdan brought with him the
                    work ethic and interpersonal skills needed to make a better life for himself and to create
                    opportunities for his family.

                        learning the importance of customer communication and hard work. After graduating college, they
                        saw an opportunity to bring the signature Hamdan charm and quality to New York City in new ways.

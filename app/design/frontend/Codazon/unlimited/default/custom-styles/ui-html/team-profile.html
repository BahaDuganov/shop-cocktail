                Early Farm Life
            </div>

            <div class="_description">
                Sam grew up on the farm with dirt under his nails. He worked the field himself, learning the exact right
                sound a watermelon should make when you knock on it so it ripens just in time to be enjoyed by the
                roadside customers.
                <br><br>
                The first of four children, Sam has always been a born leader. He’s also a born communicator. Sam was
                put in charge of the public store on the farm at 16 and he learned the names and orders of all his
                customers by heart.
                <br><br>
                He met his wife Karen running the store, they shared a love of the outdoors but also a dream of city
                life.

                Finding Peace in the City
            </div>

            <div class="_description">
                After marrying, the couple moved to Springfield, Illinois. Sam took the first sales job he could get as
                Karen stayed home to care for their first child, Tommy. After years of working for his father and
                family, Sam had an independent streak he couldn’t shake. He knew being an office salesmen wasn’t right
                for him, or for his family.
                <br><br>
                It was in 1992 when he and his family traveled back to the farm for the holidays when he was talking to
                his brother Eddy that he came up with the idea to open Green Grocer in Springfield.
                <br><br>
                He saw the promise of bringing the rural charm and togetherness to a larger city and a larger community.
